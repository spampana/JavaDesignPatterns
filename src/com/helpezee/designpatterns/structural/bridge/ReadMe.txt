Bridge Design Pattern
---------------------

This is pattern is similar to adapter pattern  with main difference is bridge works with new code whereas 
adapter works with legacy code.

When we have interface hierarchies in both interfaces as well as implementations, then 
bridge design pattern is used to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation 
details from the client programs.
